## 1. Intro 
Basically I worked with HTML5 and CSS3 to create a web page, in this case (Google Clone).


## 2. That developed?
Firts purpose for the development of this site was to develop my skills in web page creation, as well as to introduce me to web page design. 

The project is focused on building the google interface, focusing on its UI/UX in order to replicate its behavior and style, whose interface is divided as follows:

*  Header ; Google's central navigation, for example... User profile picture, icons and menu.
*  Main ; Container of the main elements of the page and the most important elements of the interface, for example... Logo, search bar, icons and buttons...
*  Footer ; Extra information for the user and links at the bottom of the page. 

## 3. Project goals 
The main objective of the site, as its name mentions, is to be a "clone" of the google home page. Look like Google,  have the google structure and the same content.
